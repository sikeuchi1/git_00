## First Verse 
All in the golden afternoon 

Full leisurely we glide; 

For both our oars, with little skill, 

By little arms are plied, 

While little hands make vain pretence 

Our wanderings to guide. 

## Second Verse
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood 

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Third Verse
The sun was shining on the sea, 

Shining with all his might: 

He did his very best to make 

The billows smooth and bright â€” 

And this was odd, because it was 

The middle of the night.
